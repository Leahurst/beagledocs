#The Beagle Desktop Client#

##Introduction##
The Beagle Desktop Client is a small Windows application which can be installed on your computer to provide extended functionality in Beagle. Some features of Beagle require the Beagle Desktop Client to be installed, such as printing.

##Downloading and Installing##
The Beagle Desktop Client can be downloaded from the [http://beagle/downloads](Beagle Downloads) page. Once downloaded, run the wizard to install the application.

The Beagle Desktop Client is fairly unobtrusive, so once you've finished installing it you won't see much change. However, if you look next to the clock in the bottom-right corner of Windows, you should notice a small Beagle icon.

##Using the Beagle Desktop Client##
Most of the time the Beagle Desktop Client will just sit in the background and you won't need to open it. However, it is possible to open the application by double-clicking the Beagle icon in the Notification Area (next to the Windows clock), and you will need to do this after you first install the application so as to set up which printers you want Beagle to use. See the Default Document Printer and Default Label Printer headings in the Settings section below.

The application's main window displays a log of connections to the Beagle server. There may be a lot of entries here - this is completely normal as the application disconnects from the server whenever your computer is idle for a period of time.

Under the *File* option in the toolbar at the top of this window is the option to close the application. This is the only way to correctly close the application. Clicking the cross in the top-right corner of the window will only minimise the application. You shouldn't close the Beagle Desktop Client application under normal circumstances as this will interfere with some Beagle functionality.

###Settings###
Selecting the *Settings* option from the toolbar at the top of the main window will open the Settings window. There are a number of settings here, but you should not change most of these unless advised to do so by the Beagle Team.  Doing so could prvevent the Beagle Desktop Client from functioning correctly. The settings available are as follows:

####Print Hub URL####
This the URL that the application connects to for communicating with the Beagle server. DO NOT ALTER THIS SETTINGS UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

####Print Queue Location####
This is the location of the documents which are sent by Beagle for printing by the Beagle Desktop Client. DO NOT ALTER THIS SETTINGS UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

####Default Document Printer####
From this dropdown list you should select the printer to which you want Beagle documents to be sent for printing. If no selection is made, the Beagle Desktop Client will print to the printer set as default in Windows.

####Default Label Printer####
From this dropdown list you should select the printer to which you want Beagle labels to be sent for printing. The selected printer should be a dedicated label printer, such as a Dymo label printer. Most computers do not have such a printer connected, and in that situation the selection should be left blank.
